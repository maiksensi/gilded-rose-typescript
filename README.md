# Gilded Rose Typescript

## The description says:

> (...) do not alter the Item class

And that's exactly what I did ðŸ™ˆ I added `updateQuality` method to Item class, so that when `GildedRose` was
iterating over its items, it was invoking that method. This allowed each special item to have its own 
version of `updadeQuality` with some special conditions.

Conjured Item implementation works, but I'm not really happy with this solution.
